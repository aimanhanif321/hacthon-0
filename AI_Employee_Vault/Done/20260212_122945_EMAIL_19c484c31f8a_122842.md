Let’s be honest: Kubernetes is complicated. But this hasn’t stopped us from including it in our mission to simplify the developer experience.

DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) makes K8s easy. With DOKS, [deploy your fully managed cluster](https://youtu.be/8SeM4qHNP8U) in minutes or follow our product team along for [a thorough video overview](https://youtu.be/flQXSbc8hBI) on setting up a cluster and using the different features available.

DOKS is business ready at an affordable price.

Hear about the DOKS advantage from the community and our customers:

- DevOps Directive published an [analysis of costs for various managed Kubernetes services](https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/03/managed-kubernetes-comparison/#cost-breakdown) showing DOKS as significantly cheaper than AKS, EKS, and GKE.
- [Podiant switched to DigitalOcean after experiencing high costs and memory limitations](https://www.digitalocean.com/customers/podiant?utm_medium=email&utm_source=education&utm_campaign=gettingstarted) with AWS and Heroku.
- [Running on DOKS cost Urlbox about half as much](https://www.digitalocean.com/customers/urlbox?utm_medium=email&utm_source=education&utm_campaign=gettingstarted) as Google Kubernetes Engine.

If you want to learn about K8s, we can help. Our free course – “[Kubernetes for Full-Stack Developers](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/curriculums/kubernetes-for-full-stack-developers?utm_medium=email&utm_source=education&utm_campaign=gettingstarted)” – will get you started step by step or help you brush up on related topics.

And don’t forget, once you log in and verify your identity, use code DIVE200IN to get $200 in credit. That will easily cover using our managed services for 60 days so that you can test the waters (for free, of course).
