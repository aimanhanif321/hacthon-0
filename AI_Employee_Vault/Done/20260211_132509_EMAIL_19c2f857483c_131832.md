Trend Watch: DigitalOcean's February 2026 Currents report findings

At DigitalOcean, we’re tracking how digital-native enterprises are using the latest AI technologies—from OpenAI's APIs to open-source models like Llama—to build the next generation of applications. It’s fascinating to understand how companies are deploying AI, and this understanding also informs how we’re expanding our own DigitalOcean GradientTM [AI inference cloud](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gradient?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025&utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feb+newsletter+1) to help customers scale AI applications affordably.

- AI agents aren’t a fleeting use case—they’re the future. A majority (60%) of respondents considered “applications and agents” to provide the most long-term, future-proof value in their AI tech stack. It’s also the top-ranked spending area for AI budgets in the next year.
- Agents bring ROI to organizations. Fifty-three percent of companies us
