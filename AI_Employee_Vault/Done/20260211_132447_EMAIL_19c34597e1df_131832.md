Your free cluster was suspended
Your free cluster, book [https://cloud.qdrant.io/accounts/dc7baad3-16d0-4638-ada1-f0c63f65fe66/clusters/bbd219c3-0e82-41d3-b6d5-8ffa5424b40f] (ID: bbd219c3-0e82-41d3-b6d5-8ffa5424b40f) has been suspended due to inactivity and will be permanently deleted in 3 weeks.

What this means:

 * Your application cannot access cluster data until the cluster is reactivated.
 * Cluster data will be retained for 3 weeks. During this period you can reactivate the cluster at any point to continue.
 * If not reactivated within 3 weeks, the cluster will be permanently deleted, and all data will be lost.
