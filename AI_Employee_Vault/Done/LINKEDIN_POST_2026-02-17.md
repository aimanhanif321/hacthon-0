## Post Content

🤖 What if your business had a digital employee that never sleeps?

I just built an AI Employee that autonomously handles:
• Email triage and responses
• Social media content across 4 platforms
• Invoice creation in Odoo accounting
• Task processing with human-in-the-loop approvals

The key insight? Full automation isn't the goal — smart collaboration is.

My system uses an Obsidian vault as a state machine. Files flow through folders (Inbox → Needs_Action → Pending_Approval → Done), and humans approve sensitive actions before execution. It's deployed on Azure with 24/7 operation.

Built for the Personal AI Employee Hackathon using Claude Code as the reasoning engine.

What business process would you automate first if you had an AI employee?
