## Post Content

🤖 Behind the scenes: My AI Employee in action!

I built an autonomous digital assistant that handles my business operations 24/7. Here's what it does:

✅ Reads and triages emails automatically
✅ Creates invoices in Odoo accounting
✅ Drafts social media posts (like this one!)
✅ Processes tasks with smart prioritization

The secret? Human-in-the-loop approval for sensitive actions. The AI proposes, I approve, then it executes.

It's running on Azure with an Obsidian vault as the brain. Files flow through folders like a state machine: Inbox → Needs_Action → Pending_Approval → Done.

Built for the Personal AI Employee Hackathon using Claude Code.

What would you automate if you had an AI assistant? 💭
