Our reimagined PaaS (Platform as a Service) makes it a lot easier to build, deploy, and scale dynamic apps as well as static sites.

Simply point to your GitHub repository, and let [App Platform](?utm_medium=email&utm_source=education&utm_campaign=gettingstarted) manage the infrastructure, app runtimes, and other dependencies.

Choose from the following plans:

Starter (from $0/month)
If you want to deploy only static sites, your first three static sites are free.

Basic (from $5/month)
Prototype your dynamic app and deploy static site components at no additional charge.

Professional (from $12/month)
Deploy your production apps as well as static site components at no additional charge.

Visit the App Platform [product docs](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=education&utm_campaign=gettingstarted) or follow along these sample guides along to get started:
