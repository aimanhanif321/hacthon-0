## Body

Hi there,


We’ve just launched a new free tool atwww.englishgrammar.org/very-replacer [https://app.getresponse.com/email_marketing_click.html?x=a62b&co=wKUcK0&lc=zhq59t&mc=CX&s=B2pCgqX&u=BH4&z=ESjqFl3&].


It helps you replace “very + adjective” with a more precise word (for example,very tired→exhausted).


Simply type in a word, copy the replacement, or save it to your own shareable list.


We’d really appreciate any feedback you have to help us improve it!


Have a great day,
Jenn
